## Research Interests

- AI for Software Engineering
- Human Aspects of Software Engineering
- Requirements Engineering
- User Feedback and Social Media Analysis

My research interests encompass a range of strategies, tooling, and insights aimed at enhancing software development processes and practices. My current research focuses on building tools and techniques to synthesize raw online user feedback into requirements through empirical research, collaboration with industry practitioners, and analysis of online repositories. My work automates the process for end-user feedback analysis and brings forth best practices for effectively managing user feedback for requirements engineering.
